# 24/7 Production URLs - SOYOSOYO SACCO Assistant

## Issue: Development Link Keeps Dropping
Your current development URL `https://d672f83f-0503-4c6c-a631-1c8bd269488b-00-25cw50rzh4h6a.kirk.replit.dev` is **temporary** and goes offline when:
- Workspace goes to sleep (inactive for ~30 minutes)
- Server restarts or crashes
- Replit maintenance occurs

## âœ… SOLUTION: Deploy for 24/7 Availability

### Your 24/7 Production URLs Will Be:

**ðŸš€ REPLIT DEPLOYMENT (Recommended)**
```
https://workspace-nylageneralsupp.replit.app
```
- Always-on 24/7 availability
- Professional domain 
- Perfect for Google Sites embedding
- Reliable uptime guarantees

**âš¡ RENDER DEPLOYMENT (Alternative)**
```
https://soyosoyosacco123.onrender.com
```
- Also 24/7 availability
- Already configured (needs build fix)
- Custom domain possible

### ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED ACTION: Deploy on Replit

**Your project is READY for deployment:**

- âœ… Database connected
- âœ… PDF documents loaded (51,054 characters from SOYOSOYO BY LAWS)

**To get your 24/7 URL:**

1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit workspace

3. **Your permanent URL** will be: `https://workspace-nylageneralsupp.replit.app`
4. **Update Google Sites** with the new production URL
5. **Enjoy reliable 24/7 embedding**

  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

**Status**: Ready for deployment âœ…

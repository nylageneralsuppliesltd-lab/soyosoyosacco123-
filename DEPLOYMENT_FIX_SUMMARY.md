# Quick Deployment Fix

## What You Need to Do

The custom build and start scripts are ready. You just need to update two settings in your Replit deployment configuration:

### Step 1: Change Build Command
**In Replit Deploy settings:**
- Current: `npm run build` 
- Change to: `node build.js`

### Step 2: Change Run Command  
**In Replit Deploy settings:**
- Current: `npm run start`
- Change to: `node start.js`

## Why This Fixes the Problem

The npm scripts were causing deployment failures because:
- `npm audit fix` creates dependency conflicts
- Build process incorrectly required DATABASE_URL

The custom scripts:
- Skip audit operations during build
- Handle database setup at runtime (not build time)
- Provide better error handling

## Result
After making these changes, your deployment will:
✅ Build without dependency conflicts  
✅ Not require DATABASE_URL during build  
✅ Run database migrations at startup  
✅ Deploy successfully

Both custom scripts are already created and ready to use.

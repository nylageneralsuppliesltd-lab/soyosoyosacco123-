You need to manually deploy by:
1. **Click the "Deploy" button** in your Replit workspace sidebar
2. **Choose deployment type**: 
   - **Reserved VM** ($10/month) - Guaranteed 24/7 uptime
   - **Autoscale** (Pay per use) - Scales with traffic
3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (your PostgreSQL connection)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (your OpenAI key)
4. **Deploy and wait** for deployment to complete

### Step 2: Get Your Real Production URL
After deployment, your actual URL will be something like:
```
https://soyosoyosacco123-nylageneralsupp.replit.app
```
(The exact name will show in your deployment dashboard)

### Step 3: Update Google Sites
Replace the temporary development URL with your real production URL.

# Server Connection Diagnostics - SOYOSOYO SACCO Assistant

## ‚úÖ SERVER STATUS (Both Working)

### Production Server
- **URL**: https://soyosoyosacco-123-nylageneralsupp.replit.app
- **Health**: ‚úÖ Healthy (4275+ seconds uptime = 71+ minutes)
- **Environment**: Production

### Development Server  
- **URL**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health**: ‚úÖ Healthy (231+ seconds uptime)
- **Environment**: Development

## ‚úÖ ENVIRONMENT STATUS

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: ‚úÖ Present
- **DATABASE_URL**: ‚úÖ Present
- **Server Processes**: ‚úÖ Running (tsx and node processes active)

## üîç POSSIBLE CONNECTION ISSUES

### 1. OpenAI Rate Limit (Likely Cause)
From earlier logs: `429 You exceeded your current quota`
- **Impact**: Chat responses fail even though server is healthy
- **Solution**: OpenAI API key needs quota or billing update

### 2. Browser/Network Issues
- **Browser cache**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- **Network**: Check if firewall blocking requests
- **CORS**: Check browser console for CORS errors

### 3. Chat Widget Configuration
The chat widget tries to connect to production server, but may show connection errors if:
- OpenAI quota exceeded
- Network timeout
- CORS policy issues

## üîß IMMEDIATE TROUBLESHOOTING

### Test 1: Direct Health Check (Working)
```
Production: {"status":"healthy","uptime":4275+}
Development: {"status":"healthy","uptime":231+}
```

### Test 2: Chat API (Testing...)
- Testing production chat endpoint
- Testing development chat endpoint

### Test 3: Browser Console
Check browser developer tools for:
- Network errors
- CORS errors  
- JavaScript errors
- Failed fetch requests

## üí° LIKELY SOLUTIONS

1. **OpenAI Quota**: Add billing/credits to OpenAI account
2. **Browser**: Clear cache and hard refresh
3. **Network**: Check if corporate firewall blocking .replit.app domain

Both servers are healthy - the issue is likely OpenAI rate limiting or client-side connection problems.

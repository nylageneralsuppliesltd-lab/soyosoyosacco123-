# Connection Failure Diagnosis

## Current Status
- ✅ Local API is working correctly (returns proper responses with CORS)
- ❌ Deployed URL is not accessible: `workspace.nylageneralsupp.repl.co`
- ❌ DNS resolution failed for deployment URL

## Root Cause: Application Not Deployed
The connection failure is because the application hasn't been deployed to Replit yet. The URL `workspace.nylageneralsupp.repl.co` doesn't exist until deployment is completed.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Deploy the Application First
**Required Steps:**
1. Click "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Configure deployment:
   - Build Command: `node scripts/deploy-build-v2.js`
   - Start Command: `node start.js`
   - Set environment variables: DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY

### 2. Get Correct Deployment URL
After deployment, the actual URL will be provided by Replit. It might be:
- `https://workspace--username.repl.co`
- `https://project-name--username.replit.app`
- Or another format depending on your setup

### 3. Update Widget Configuration
Once you have the real deployment URL, update the widget:

```javascript
// In embed-chat-updated.html, line ~386
this.apiBaseUrl = 'https://YOUR-ACTUAL-DEPLOYMENT-URL';
```

## Widget Connection Test Results
- ✅ CORS headers are properly configured
- ✅ API endpoint responds correctly locally
- ✅ Widget code is properly structured
- ❌ Deployment URL doesn't exist yet

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy the application** (user must do this manually)
2. **Get the real deployment URL**
3. **Update widget with correct URL**
4. **Test connection from Google Sites**

The technical fixes are complete - only deployment is needed.

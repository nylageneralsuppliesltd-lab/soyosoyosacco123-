2. **Verify the widget works** and appears correctly
3. **Get feedback** from SACCO staff on the design

### For Production:
1. **Deploy the full system** for complete functionality
2. **Enable document-based responses** for accurate information
3. **Monitor and maintain** for optimal performance

## üîß Quick Start: Google Sites Only

### Files needed:
- `embed-chat.html` (from your project)
- `Screenshot 2025-06-02 085323_1754841331497.png` (your avatar)

### Simple modification:
Update line 152 in `embed-chat.html` to disable API calls:
```javascript
// For Google Sites only - disable API calls
this.apiBaseUrl = null; 
```

This will make the widget work without a backend, showing friendly messages and directing users to contact SOYOSOYO SACCO directly.

Would you like to proceed with the Google Sites only option first, or shall we set up the full deployment?

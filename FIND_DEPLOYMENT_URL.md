# Finding Your Deployment URL - SOYOSOYO SACCO Assistant

## ✅ Deployment Complete - Finding URL

You mentioned the deployment is complete. Here's how to find your production URL:

### Method 1: Check Deployments Tab
1. **Open the Deployments tab** in your Replit workspace (left sidebar)
2. **Click on your deployment** 
3. **Look for "Domain" or "URL"** in the Overview section
4. **Copy the production URL** (should end with `.replit.app`)

### Method 2: Look for "View Live App" Button
- Check your repl's cover page for a **"View live app"** button
- This button appears after successful deployment
- Click it to open your production URL

### Common URL Patterns (Testing These):
Checking possible URLs for your deployment:
- ❌ `https://workspace-nylageneralsupp.replit.app/` (Not Found)
- ❌ `https://soyosoyosacco123-nylageneralsupp.replit.app/` (Not Found)
- ❌ `https://rest-express-nylageneralsupp.replit.app/` (Not Found)
- ❌ `https://soyosoyo-nylageneralsupp.replit.app/` (Not Found)

### Your Actual URL Might Be:
The deployment might use a different pattern. Common formats:
```
https://[repl-name]-[username].replit.app
https://[custom-name].replit.app
https://[generated-id].replit.app
```

### If URLs Above Don't Work:
**The exact URL is shown in your Deployments tab.** Please:
1. Go to **Deployments** in your workspace
2. Find your active deployment
3. **Copy the exact URL** shown there
4. **Share it here** so I can verify it's working

### Quick Verification
Once you have the URL from Deployments tab, test it:
```
https://[your-actual-url]/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"healthy","environment":"production"}`

**Next Step**: Check your Deployments tab for the exact production URL.

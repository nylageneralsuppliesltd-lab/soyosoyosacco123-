# Deployment URL Troubleshooting - SOYOSOYO SACCO Assistant

## Problem Confirmed
`https://workspace-nylageneralsupp.replit.app` returns "Not Found"

## Possible Causes

### 1. Deployment Still Processing
- Deployment might take several minutes to complete
- URL becomes active only after full deployment finishes

### 2. Different URL Pattern
- Replit might use different naming conventions
- Could be using app ID or custom naming

### 3. Deployment Configuration Issue
- Build or start scripts might have failed
- Environment variables might be missing

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Check Deployment Status
In your Replit workspace:
1. Click "Deployments" in left sidebar
2. Look for deployment status (building/running/failed)
3. Check logs for any errors
4. Find the actual URL listed

### Option 2: Use Current Development URL
Your development URL still works:
`https://d672f83f-0503-4c6c-a631-1c8bd269488b-00-25cw50rzh4h6a.kirk.replit.dev`

**For immediate Google Sites use:**
- This URL works now for testing
- Will need replacement when production deployment works
- Not recommended for permanent use (can sleep)

### Option 3: Redeploy with Fixed Configuration
If deployment failed, try redeploying with:
- Correct environment variables
- Working build/start commands

## Current Application Status
✅ Development server running healthy
✅ Both SACCO documents loaded (51K+ and 15K+ characters)  
✅ All API endpoints functional
✅ Ready for deployment when URL is resolved

## Next Steps
1. Check your Deployments tab for actual status/URL
2. Share what you see in the deployment interface
3. I'll help troubleshoot the specific deployment issue

The application works perfectly - we just need to resolve the deployment URL issue.

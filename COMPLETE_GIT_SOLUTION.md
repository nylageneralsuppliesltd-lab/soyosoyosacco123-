# Complete Git Resolution Solution

## âœ… CURRENT STATUS: APPLICATION FULLY OPERATIONAL

Your SOYOSOYO SACCO Assistant is running perfectly:
- **Server**: Healthy at http://localhost:5000 (uptime: 87+ seconds)
- **API**: All endpoints responding correctly
- **PDF Processing**: Both SACCO documents loaded successfully
- **Database**: Connected and functional
- **Code Quality**: No LSP errors or warnings

## ðŸ”§ GIT ISSUES IDENTIFIED

The repository is in a merge conflict state with:
- Diverged branches (62 local vs 14 remote commits)
- Lock file preventing operations (.git/index.lock)
- Unmerged files: package.json, package-lock.json, server/index.ts, server/storage.ts
- Modified documentation: replit.md

## ðŸ“‹ MANUAL RESOLUTION REQUIRED

Since automated Git operations are restricted, you need to manually execute these commands in your terminal:

### Commands to Run:
```bash
# 1. Remove the lock file
rm -f .git/index.lock

# 2. Abort the current merge
git merge --abort

# 3. Reset to clean state
git reset --hard HEAD

# 4. Stage all current working files
git add .

# 5. Commit the working state
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve merge conflicts - SACCO assistant operational

âœ… Application running successfully with all features
âœ… PDF document processing functional  
âœ… API endpoints healthy and tested
âœ… Database integration working
âœ… CORS enabled for external embedding
âœ… Embed widgets ready for deployment"

# 6. Push to GitHub (choose one option):

# Option A - Force push (overwrites remote):
git push origin main --force

# Option B - Create new branch (safer):
git checkout -b sacco-assistant-working
git push origin sacco-assistant-working
```

## ðŸŽ¯ WHAT THIS FIXES

After running these commands, you'll have:
- Clean Git repository synchronized with GitHub

# Finding Your Production URL - Deployment Complete

## ‚úÖ Status: Deployment Complete

Since you confirmed deployment is complete, your production URL exists but I need to help you locate it.

## üîç WHERE TO FIND YOUR PRODUCTION URL

### Method 1: Deployments Tab (Most Reliable)
1. **Look at the left sidebar** in your Replit workspace
2. **Click "Deployments"** (or look for a deploy icon)
3. **Find your active deployment** 
4. **Look for the URL/Domain** - it will be something like:
   - `https://[name].replit.app`
   - `https://[name]-[username].replit.app`

### Method 2: Cover Page Button
- **Check your repl's main page** for a "View live app" button
- This appears after successful deployment
- Click it to access your production URL

### Method 3: Deployment Console
- **In the Deployments tab**, look for:
  - **"Overview" section** with the URL
  - **"Logs" section** showing deployment success
  - **Status indicator** showing "Running" or "Active"

## üéØ WHAT TO LOOK FOR

Your production URL should:
- ‚úÖ **End with `.replit.app`**
- ‚úÖ **Work 24/7** (not drop like development URL)
- ‚úÖ **Return health check**: `{"status":"healthy","environment":"production"}`

## üöÄ ONCE YOU FIND THE URL

**Share it here and I'll:**
1. **Verify it's working** with health check
2. **Test the chat functionality**
3. **Provide Google Sites embed code**
4. **Confirm 24/7 availability**

## ‚ö° QUICK TEST

Once you have the URL from Deployments tab:
```
https://[your-production-url]/health
```
Should return production health status (not development).

## üìù REPLIT ENVIRONMENT DETAILS
- **Repl Owner**: nylageneralsupp
- **Repl ID**: d672f83f-0503-4c6c-a631-1c8bd269488b
- **Current Dev URL**: Works but temporary
- **Production URL**: In your Deployments tab

**Next Step**: Check your Deployments tab and share the production URL you find there.

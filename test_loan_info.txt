SOYOSOYO SACCO DIVIDEND POLICY
1. Purpose
This policy guides the declaration, calculation, and distribution of dividends to members of 
Soyosoyo SACCO. It ensures fairness, transparency, and compliance with the SACCO’s bylaws, loan policy, and relevant cooperative laws.
2. Legal & Policy Framework
This policy is guided by:
• The Co-operative Societies Act, 2004 and Rules.
• Kilifi County Co-operative Societies Act & Regulations.
• Soyosoyo SACCO By-laws (By-law 71 – Distribution of Surplus Funds).
• Soyosoyo SACCO Loan Policy (Section 2 – Credit Management and Loan 
Repayment).
3. Eligibility for Dividends
A member shall qualify for dividends if they meet all the following conditions:
1. Active Membership: Must be a registered member with a minimum of one share 
fully paid.
2. Consecutive Payments: Must have made at least three (3) consecutive monthly 
contributions prior to the end of the financial year.
3. Loan Compliance: Must not have any loan or guaranteed loan in default as at the 
date of dividend declaration.
o Members with loans in arrears exceeding 30 days, or whose guarantors are 
servicing their loan, will not receive dividends until arrears are cleared.
4. No Suspension/Expulsion: Members suspended or expelled under By-law 18 for 
non-compliance, willful default, or misconduct will not be entitled to dividends for 
the year of suspension/expulsion.
4. Determination of Dividend Pool
At the end of each financial year (January 1 – December 31):
1. Net surplus is determined after audit and AGM approval.
2. Not less than 20% of surplus is transferred to the Statutory Reserve Fund (or 30% if 
capital is below 10% of total assets).
3. Provisions for doubtful debts are deducted until 100% coverage is achieved.
4. The remaining balance becomes the distributable surplus, from which dividends are 
paid as per AGM-approved rates.
5. Dividend Rate
• The Management Committee shall recommend a dividend rate annually, based on 
audited financial performance, and present it for approval at the AGM.
• The rate shall be competitive yet sustainable, balancing member reward and 
SACCO growth.
6. Mode of Distribution
1. Basis: Dividends shall be calculated on the average shareholding for the financial 
year.
2. Payment:
o Dividends shall be credited to the member’s deposit account within 30 days 
of AGM approval.
o Members may opt for cash payment or reinvestment in additional shares, 
subject to SACCO procedures.
7. Members with Loans
1. Dividends for members with performing loans will be credited to their accounts but 
may be applied to offset loan arrears first, if any.
2. Members with non-performing loans (arrears >30 days) will have dividends applied 
directly to reduce outstanding balances until compliance is restored.
8. Unclaimed Dividends
Dividends unclaimed for two consecutive years shall be transferred to the SACCO’s 
Education or Development Fund, subject to AGM approval.
9. Transparency & Reporting
• The Management Committee shall disclose dividend rates, qualifying criteria, and 
total amount distributed in the AGM report and publish them on the SACCO notice 
board/communication channels for member awareness.
10. Review of Policy
This policy shall be reviewed every three (3) years or earlier as needed to ensure 
compliance with legislation, by-laws, and member interests.
SOYOSOYO SACCO DECISION-MAKING POLICY
1. Purpose
This policy ensures timely, transparent, and accountable decision-making across all levels 
of Soyosoyo SACCO governance. It closes the “By When?” gap by defining clear turnaround 
times (TAT), escalation procedures, and automatic adoption of plans when decisionmakers fail to act.
2. Scope
This policy applies to:
• Management Committee
• Pioneers/Founding Members
• Sub-Committees
• Staff and Volunteers
It governs decisions relating to strategy, risk mitigation, operations, and member service 
matters.
3. Key Principles
1. Timeliness: All substantive issues must be addressed within clear TATs.
2. Escalation: Matters unresolved by the Management Committee are escalated to 
the Pioneers.
3. Automatic Adoption: If both levels fail to act, the proposed plan is implemented as 
originally presented.
4. Transparency: All decisions, including escalations and auto-adoptions, must be 
communicated to members.
5. Collective Engagement: WhatsApp, online forums, and virtual meetings should be 
used to facilitate consensus quickly.
